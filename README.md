## A Simple JS project to find github user
This is a simple project I made with the sole purpose of learning the core concept of learning js.
In this project, I have learned to use fetch api, async and await function.
also I've also get myself familiar with dom manipulation. This is probably the most fascinating thing of Js that I found.
